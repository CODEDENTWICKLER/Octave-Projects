# Octave-Projects
Implementation of Mathematical Algoirithms in Numeriacal Computation

## Getting Started
Clone this Repo to Local file named Octave-Projects
Use the command on git bash or terminal

```
git clone 
```

### Prerequisites
You need to have Octave GNU Installed on your Computer

Check out how to install here

```
https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
```
Matlab will do just fine but you might need tp make certain changes,
I will recommend you use Octave

###
This Project include implementations of Simple and Complex Algorithms

Basic Implementation Of more precise Infinite Series Expansion Of some functions like

The Exponential Function
The Sine, Cos, Tan, Cosh,Cosec,Sec, Sech, Tanh, Cosech, ...

Computing Machine Gamma and Epsilon

Fixed Point and Two - Point Method like
The Bisection Method
Newton Ralphson Method
Regula Falsi

Canonical Form Of Polynomial and Horners Form Implemtation

Interpolation Tehniques like
